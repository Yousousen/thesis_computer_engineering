To this end, some researchers have advocated the use of metrics developed for assessing automotive safety, with the head injury criterion (HIC) receiving particular attention. The aims of this commentary are to clarify the proper use of the HIC, to briefly discuss its relationship to the risk of injury, and to give a closed-form formula for the HIC value produced by a simple mass-spring model of impact. We emphasize that there are many other factors besides HIC to consider before a robot system can be considered safe to interact with humans.</p>},

In the case of a careless collision between a robot and a human, impact force and impact stress are chosen as evaluation measures, and a danger-index is defined to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of each safety strategy used for design and control. As a result, this proposed method allows us to assess the contribution of each safety strategy to the overall safety performance of a human-care robot. In addition, a new type of three-dimensional robot simulation system for danger evaluation is constructed on a PC. The system simplifies the danger evaluation of both the design and control of various types of human-care robots to quantify the effectiveness of various safety strategies. </p>},

abstract = "In practice, the problem of motion control of the wheeled mobile robots is often neglected. Wheeled mobile robots are strongly nonlinear systems and restricted by non-holonomic constraints. Motion control of such systems is not trivial task and usage of non-optimal control signals can lead to deterioration of the overall robot system's performance. In case of autonomous application of the mobile robots all parts of its control system should work perfectly. The paper presents the theory and application of the optimal control method at the energy performance index towards motion control of the two-wheeled mobile robot during the realisation of complex, dynamically created trajectories. With the use of the proposed control method the two-wheeled mobile robot can realise effectively the desired trajectory, which is generated ad-hoc by the navigation system of the robot. Thus the proposed method can be used for motion control of autonomous or semi-autonomous wheeled mobile robots. The presented results of both computer simulations and experiments indicate that the proposed method works effectively from the point of view of the motion control of two-wheeled mobile robot. Movement of the mobile robot appeared reliable and predictable during all the tests."

The Human-Robot Interactive (HRI) system, which allows one person to interact with a service robot using natural body language, collects sequences of 3D skeleton joints comprising rich human movement information about the user via Microsoft Kinect. This information is used to train a three-layer Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for human action recognition. The robot understands user intent based on an online LSTM network test, and responds to the user via movements of the robotic arm or chassis. Furthermore, the human-like decision mechanism is also fused into this process, which allows the robot to instinctively decide whether to interrupt the current task according to task priority. The framework of the overall system is established on the Robot Operating System (ROS) platform. The real-life activity interaction between our service robot and the user was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of developed HRI system.},
