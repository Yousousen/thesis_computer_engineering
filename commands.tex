\newcommand{\mq}{How can a real-time safety module be designed and implemented that provides an extra layer of safety in order to prevent injury to patients or damage to the environment because of collision, clamping or pinching caused by care robot Rose?}
% Interface to Rose. Communication over ethernet, fast enough.
\newcommand{\sqone}{What hardware and operating system can be used to implement a safety module that has real-time constraints for care robot Rose?}
\newcommand{\sqtwo}{How can sensor data be retrieved and how can sensor be used to check for unsafe behavior?}
% Certain things that cannot be done mechanically (essentially why we need to use the safety module in the first place).
% This should specify the entire deal having to do with the modelling real-time constraints in dezyne and the other means of verification of the safety module.
\newcommand{\sqthree}{How can the operational behavior of the safety module be modelled in a formal specification language?}
%\newcommand{\sqfour}{How can we implement the formal specification on the hardware and how can we implement the formal specification in software?}
\newcommand{\sqfour}{How can we implement the safety module using the formal specification on a real-time operating system?}
