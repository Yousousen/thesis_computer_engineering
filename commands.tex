\newcommand{\mq}{How can a real-time safety module be designed and implemented that prevents injury to patients or damage to the environment because of collision, clamping or pinching caused by care robot Rose?}
% Interface to Rose. Communication over ethernet, fast enough.
\newcommand{\sqone}{What hardware and operating system can be used to implement a safety module that has real-time constraints for care robot Rose?}
\newcommand{\sqtwo}{How can sensor and actuator data be retrieved?}
% Certain things that cannot be done mechanically (essentially why we need to use the safety module in the first place).
\newcommand{\sqthree}{How can sensor and actuator data be used to check for unsafe behaviour?}
% This should specify the entire deal having to do with the modelling real-time constraints in dezyne and the other means of verification of the safety module.
\newcommand{\sqfour}{How can the safety module be modelled in relation to the real-time care robot such that the model guarantees that unsafe behaviour is detected and signalled and that the safety module meets all of its deadlines?}
\newcommand{\sqfive}{How can we implement the model on the hardware and how can we implement it in software?}
