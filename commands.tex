\newcommand{\mq}{How can a real-time safety module be designed and implemented that provides an extra layer of safety in order to prevent injury to patients or damage to the environment because of collision, clamping or pinching caused by care robot Rose?}
% Interface to Rose. Communication over ethernet, fast enough.
\newcommand{\sqone}{What hardware and real-time operating system can be used to implement the safety module?}
\newcommand{\sqtwo}{How can sensor data be retrieved and how can sensor be used to check for unsafe behavior?}
% Certain things that cannot be done mechanically (essentially why we need to use the safety module in the first place).
% This should specify the entire deal having to do with the modelling real-time constraints in dezyne and the other means of verification of the safety module.
\newcommand{\sqthree}{How can the operational behavior of the safety module be modelled in a formal specification language?}
%\newcommand{\sqfour}{How can we implement the formal specification on the hardware and how can we implement the formal specification in software?}
\newcommand{\sqfour}{How can the safety module safety module be implemented, using the formal specifcation, on a real-time operating system?}
